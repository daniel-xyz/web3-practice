# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract, a test for that contract and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

1. Compile

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

2. Test

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
```

3. Deploy

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
